# Kaggle-Credit-Fraud-Detection


This file is based on the credit fraud dataset on Kaggle.


You can download the dataset here at : https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud


The dataset has been anonymized, so no domain knowledge on finance is really required.


The file will walk through an exploration of the dataset, and then used several methods such as oversampling/undersampling combined with Logistic Regression, Random Tree Classifier and Decision Tree Classifier ....

I learned about undersampling/oversampling using this link: https://towardsdatascience.com/outlier-detection-with-one-class-svms-5403a1a1878c
